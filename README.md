IMAD essay: (Explaining the history app with its codes)

Background image of the cover age:

This is the background image used in my history app. It is very significant as it portrays the passing of
time. It also highlights the fact that time waits for nobody and that anything can happen at any given
moment. The image consists of a book that is opened in the middle and a time object. It is part of
the introduction. The application consists of a background image, a clear button, a generate button,
an exit button, a space provided for you to insert your age for the app to match it with a famous
person (you may also enter different ages) and a title called the “History App”.

In today’s fast-paced world, connecting with the past can often feel distant and inaccessible
however, with the history app given, I managed to code and insert many different instructions to
make the history app generate and match the text that was inputted with an old famous person who
passed away.

Fortunately, we live in a generation where technology is advanced as it has evolved, I am truly
grateful that it became useful enough to assist us with many different tasks at hand. Imagine an app
that offers users the opportunity to discover famous individuals who lived up until the same age as
them. That can be a very interesting fact as it provides a unique perspective on the past, history
itself and evolution. It fosters a sense of connection with the past generations. In this essay I will be
diving deep into the potential benefits of this innovative and unique application.

By linking individuals with famous people who lived during a similar time-period, the app creates a
platform for intergenerational knowledge. Users can gain insights and more background knowledge
and information about a specific individual by even entering a random age if they are playing around
in the app and if they are curious about learning and matching ages. People who have matching ages
with historical figures foster a deeper appreciation for the past and a sense of continuity across
generations.

Beyond facilitating personal connections, this history app plays and holds a significant role in
educational value and self-gain. Through curated profiles and biographical information, users can
learn and study about the lives and contributions of notable individuals from various fields such as
creative arts, physics and chemistry in science, politics and literature. By also contextualizing
historical events of peoples lives the history application enriches users with a better understanding
of history and it also positively encourages and motivates further exploration by creating curiosity of
cultures and different time periods.

For many users, discovering a famous figure who achieved or overcame adversity during the same
stage of life can be inspiring. By highlighting the accomplishments instead of struggles, the
application servers as a source of empowerment and motivation. Users may hopefully also find
comfort and encouragement in knowing more about the history of their country and the fact that
individuals from the past experienced similar obstacles and that some things haven’t changed from
the past and we can use that to learn.
Users may uncover unexpected similarities or differences with historical counterpart, which could
potentially lead to moments of self-discovery and introspection. This reflective journey enhances
self-awareness and could facilitate personal recognition. Connecting to the past, especially by
connecting with a famous historical figure, users become active by participating in the ongoing
narrative of human history.
In the digital age, the development of mobile applications has become increasingly prevalent,
shaping, and organizing various aspects of our daily lives.

Behind the scenes of every successful app lies a complex complicated process of coding, wherein
programmers utilize different programming languages and technologies to bring ideas to life. I am
about to dive into the multifaceted role of coding in app development, exploring, investigating, and
finding challenges to ensure success. Coding empowered this history app to be able to deliver
personalized experiences tailored to users that enter input. Advanced algorithms analyze users age
data and preferences to generate curated lists of famous people’s deaths that are the most relevant
and engaging to every single designated person. Coding also enables developers to continuously
improve, and update history apps based on the user’s feedback and technological advancements.
Through agile development methodologies and version control systems, coders iteratively enhance
app functionality by addressing bugs, issues, and glitches. By making sure that the history app
remains relevant, regular updates ensure that the application does not get outdated and inaccurate
thus, it is vitally important to engage and provide users with fresh new content over experiences
overtime.

App Functions:

The generate button function processes the input in which a user enters in the space provided (the
“enter your age” part) and it generates the age by matching it with a famous person who lived in the
last generation which is the 1900s.

The clear button removes and clears all of the text that was entered above the generate button
which is the input field and it is a shortcut to save time by taking away any numbers that were
entered in the text field. This action is typically used to clear input fields when adding a new object
as it acts like a short cut to removing all displayed numbers.

The exit buttons (which are also called a “close“ button) function is to exit the application in order to
close the application when a user is done using the history app. It also removes any unsaved
information in the application. Clicking or tapping the exit button will cause the application to close.
It will also delete text.

When a specific age is entered the result text names consist of: Paul Adams who passed away at the
age of 30, Zygmunt Janiszewski who passed away at the age of 31, Benito Perez Galdos who passed
away at the age of 36, John Francis Dodge who passed away at the age of 41, Reginald De Koven
who passed away at the age of 42, Georg Lurich who passed away at the age of 50, Ameoeo
Hodigliani who passed away at the age of 57, Alexander Vasilevich Kolchak who passed away at the
age of 60, Richard Denmel who passed away at the age of 64, Emile Sauret who passed away at the
age of 70, Jean Allemane who passed away at the age of 71, Ottalee Baker who passed away at the
age of 72, Jacinta Marto who passed away at the age of 79 and Alexander IL “yinsky” who passed
away at the age of 100. The goal of the result text is to match the user with one of these famous
people and if a user enters any other number the result test will state “No match found!”

In conclusion, I hope to emphasize the significance of connecting specific users with historical
famous people and to highlight the apps potential impact on understanding history. I also encourage
further exploration of historical context beyond the app itself. I hope all users engage with these
famous people in a meaningful way and enjoy the application.
